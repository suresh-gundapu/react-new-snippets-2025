Super ra macha! Letâ€™s dive into **React Hooks** â€” in a **clear + real-time style** thatâ€™s perfect for interviews and projects.

## ðŸ’¡ What are Hooks in React?

> **Hooks** are special functions that let you **use React features like state, lifecycle, and context** in functional components (without using class components).

ðŸ§  Before hooks: Only class components had lifecycle and state.
âœ… After hooks: **Functional components** can do everything.

## âœ… Commonly Used Hooks

| Hook          | Used For                                     |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `useState`    | Manage local state                           |
| `useEffect`   | Handle side effects (API, timers, lifecycle) |
| `useRef`      | Store mutable value, DOM reference           |
| `useContext`  | Access context data                          |
| `useMemo`     | Optimize expensive calculations              |
| `useCallback` | Optimize functions in re-renders             |
| `useReducer`  | Manage complex state logic (like Redux)      |

## ðŸ”§ Real-Time Usage of Each Hook

---

### ðŸ”¹ `useState` â€“ store and update data

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

ðŸ“¦ Real example: Like/Unlike button, input fields, toggle views.

---

### ðŸ”¹ `useEffect` â€“ side effects (like lifecycle)

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();

  return () => {
    console.log("Component unmounted");
  };
}, []);
```

ðŸ“¦ Real example: API calls, localStorage sync, timer setup, cleanup.

---

### ðŸ”¹ `useRef` â€“ access DOM or persist data without re-render

```jsx
const inputRef = useRef();

const focusInput = () => {
  inputRef.current.focus();
};
```

ðŸ“¦ Real example: Focus input, track previous state, scroll to element.

---

### ðŸ”¹ `useContext` â€“ global data without props drilling

```jsx
const user = useContext(UserContext);
```

ðŸ“¦ Real example: Auth data, theme settings, user info globally.

---

### ðŸ”¹ `useMemo` â€“ cache expensive calculation

```jsx
const result = useMemo(() => heavyFunction(data), [data]);
```

ðŸ“¦ Real example: Large table filters, search results, chart data.

---

### ðŸ”¹ `useCallback` â€“ prevent re-creating same function

```jsx
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  console.log("Clicked!");
}, []);
```

ðŸ“¦ Real example: Child components depending on parent functions.

---

### ðŸ”¹ `useReducer` â€“ manage complex state

```jsx
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment': return { count: state.count + 1 };
    default: return state;
  }
};

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });
```

ðŸ“¦ Real example: Cart management, form state, Redux alternative.

## ðŸ§  Real-Time Interview Answer:

> "Hooks are functions that allow functional components to manage state and side effects, just like class components. I use `useState` for local state, 
`useEffect` for API calls and cleanup, `useRef` for DOM access, and `useContext` for global data. Hooks make components cleaner and more reusable."
