🔥 Super macha! Let’s clearly understand **React Fragments** – one of those neat features that often confuses beginners but gets asked in interviews.

## 💡 What is a Fragment in React?

> **Fragments** let you return **multiple elements** from a component **without adding an extra HTML tag** to the DOM.

### ❌ Problem Without Fragments:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Title</h1>
      <p>Paragraph</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Above code is fine… but what if you **don’t want that extra `<div>`**?

✅ That’s where **React.Fragment** comes in.

## ✅ React Fragment Syntax (2 ways)

### 🔹 1. **Full syntax**:

```jsx
return (
  <React.Fragment>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Paragraph</p>
  </React.Fragment>
);
```

### 🔹 2. **Short syntax (commonly used):**

```jsx
return (
  <>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Paragraph</p>
  </>
);
```

🧠 **No `<div>` will be added in the DOM**.

## 📦 Real-Time Example: Table Rows

```jsx
function Row() {
  return (
    <>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Koushik</td>
    </>
  );
}
```

👉 You **can’t wrap `<td>` in `<div>`**, so Fragment is best choice here.

## 🧠 Interview Style Answer:

> “React Fragment is used when we want to return multiple elements from a component without adding an extra DOM node like `<div>`. This helps keep the DOM clean and avoids unwanted nesting. We can use `<React.Fragment>` or just shorthand `<> </>`.”
